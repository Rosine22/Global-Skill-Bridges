# 📧 Email Service Setup for Password Recovery

The email functionality has been fully implemented! Here's what you need to do to get emails working:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (For Testing)

### Option 1: Ethereal Email (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to https://ethereal.email/create
2. Create a free test account
3. You'll get SMTP credentials like:
   ```
   Host: smtp.ethereal.email
   Port: 587
   Username: generated.username@ethereal.email  
   Password: generated.password
   ```

### Option 2: Gmail (For Production)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Generate an App Password
4. Use your Gmail address and the App Password

## 📝 Environment Configuration

Create or update your `.env` file in the `backend` folder with these variables:

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.ethereal.email
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your.ethereal.username@ethereal.email
EMAIL_PASS=your.ethereal.password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@globalskillsbridge.com
CLIENT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5174

# For Gmail instead:
